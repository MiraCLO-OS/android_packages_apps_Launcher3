/**
 * MiraCLO: the ColorOS ("stacked") recents style.
 *
 * The focused task keeps its normal place and size, so the swipe-up and quick-switch animations
 * are untouched. Older tasks are tucked behind it: each one only shows a strip of its edge, the
 * strips get thinner the deeper the task is, and deeper tasks are slightly smaller. Newer tasks
 * (only visible after scrolling into older ones) keep the normal spacing and are drawn on top.
 *
 * Proportions were measured from ColorOS: the first older card shows ~23% of its width, the next
 * ones a few percent each, and each card is ~4% smaller than the one in front of it.
